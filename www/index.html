Purpose:

<! Build a single page to-do list, mobile web application using Angular.js, and package it with PhoneGap Build. 

1.	Based on an MVC pattern. Your JS app will include a Model (i.e. scope), a View (i.e. HTML file) and a controller (i.e. in a separate js file). 
2.	“To Do” items will be displayed in a simple HTML list. 
3.	The app will include a form to add list items. 
4.	Two-way data binding. Adding an item via the form will update the model and therefore immediately update the view. Hint: Use Angular directives. 
5.	A config.xml file for PhoneGap. Hint: At the same level as your index.html. 
6.	A (customized) default icon. 
7.	Zip your package and upload to a PUBLIC PhoneGap project.
8.	Your submission to moodle should contain the same set of files, as well as the QR code generated by PhoneGap.
Additional Notes:
Got code from https://angularjs.org/
advanced topics – scroll down to end of page 
Also got lots of help from Damian o'Rourke- he discovered my samsung phone version couldn't read the qr code from phonegap and helped with creation of config file
Since I didn't have a phone available all the time to test the qr code, I kept the version with hardly any coments as I wasnt sure if the comments woud prevent the whole thing from working.
